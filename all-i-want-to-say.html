    <h1>All I Want To Say</h1>

    <p>I know babe that the last few days have been rough for us that we even started questioning ourselves. We questioned every choice that we made. All I want to say is:</p>

    <p>...that I am sorry for hurting you, I would never want to do that and I will try not to do anything that hurt you.</p>

    <p>...that I will keep in mind things that you have told me to be cautious about,</p>

    <p>...that I will try my best to show you how much I love you</p>

    <p>...that I know that every time we had an issue you wanted care, love, affection from me, and I was not able to show it to you, but believe me, I care a lot for you. You know I am bad at expressing things, I think every other boy is, but wo pyaar he kya jo insaan ko badal na de.. so my love, I will try, I will keep on trying, I will try till the end of eternity...</p>

    <p>...that whenever I see your eyes, don't even ask what I feel. So beautiful, so innocent that I get lost in them. I think about you a lot baby, and whenever I think of you I can only think of the moment when you look at me with those eyes... it makes me weak, in a good sense, it makes me melt... I love your eyes</p>

    <p>...that whenever I listen to a song, I imagine you and me singing that song, enjoying our lives together, travelling all over the world (Nepal pahle), driving, going to amusement parks, trekking, gymming and all the infinite things that we have to dooooooo.....</p>

    <p class="big-love">that I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu</p>

    <p>that you are my jaan, that you are my waterfallllllll.....</p>

    <p class="kiss">muaaahhhhhhhhh</p>
